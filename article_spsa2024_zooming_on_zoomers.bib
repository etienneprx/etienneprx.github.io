  abstract = {Independence movements are a feature of multiple stateless territorially concentrated nations in established democracies including Canada, Spain and the United Kingdom. Women's and feminist movements in democracies are directly engaged in these nation-building processes. Multiple investigations have examined the factors that lead citizens to favor independence but none to date have focussed on the potential role of feminist identity in shaping these attitudes. In this paper, we investigate the link between feminism and support for independence via the example of the debate over sovereignty in the province of Quebec in Canada. Using an original 2010 survey of French-speaking women in the province, we find that even after controlling for the dominant explanatory factors in the literature, women who self-identify as feminist are more likely than other women to support sovereignty. Moreover, this association varies with the strength of women's feminist identity and with the movement's engagement with sovereignty across generations. We argue that research on the determinants of independence attitudes needs to expand the set of groups included in investigations beyond those traditionally examined.},

Notre {\'e}tude, bas{\'e}e sur les donn{\'e}es d'un sondage men{\'e} en 2006, sugg{\`e}re de nuancer ces conclusions. Nos r{\'e}sultats indiquent en effet que, malgr{\'e} la hausse de l'appui {\`a} la souverainet{\'e} observ{\'e}e ces derni{\`e}res ann{\'e}es chez les jeunes allophones, les facteurs motivant leur appui ne sont pas tout {\`a} fait les m{\^e}mes que chez les francophones.

These observations have led some to conclude that, as a result of linguistic integration, immigrant youths' political opinions and behaviour have become almost undifferentiated from those of their francophone counterparts. Our study, based on a survey conducted in early 2006, provides a significantly more nuanced picture of the situation. Our results indicate that, even though young allophones may have become more supportive of Quebec sovereignty in recent years, the actual motivations behind their support are not entirely the same as those of young francophones. Young allophones appear to be very sensitive to values associated with Canadian federalism, and to the economic consequences of sovereignty. On these accounts, their behaviour more closely resembles that of young anglophones. Such contrast between francophones and allophones becomes even more striking when we examine answers to a more ``hardline'' referendum question that refers to Quebec assuming the status of a ``country.''},

What are the relative contributions of economic and linguistic expectations in this choice? Does the impact of these expectations vary according to the time horizon in which they are set? The authors approach these questions from the perspective of the economic theory of voting and with the help of original measures of the determinants of support for sovereignty. They compare expectations of what would occur to the economy and to the French language were Quebec to become a sovereign country with expectations of what would occur if Quebec remained a province of Canada. These measures are taken from a survey of university students. Our logistic regression analysis shows that the implicit calculation of costs and benefits plays a significant role in the choice between sovereignty and federalism, and that economic expectations influence the formation of opinion to a somewhat greater degree than do linguistic expectations. Moreover, medium-term expectations are more important than short-term economic expectations and more important than long-term expectations about the situation of the French language in Quebec., Pourquoi les Qu{\'e}b{\'e}cois sont-ils favorables ou oppos{\'e}s {\`a} la souverainet{\'e}?

The survey indicates that preferred constitutional options relate first and foremost to feelings of attachment to Quebec and Canada, but that fears about the potential economic consequences of separation also play an important role. Support for sovereignty, however, does not result from the belief that Quebec has been unfairly treated in the present federal system. Finally, the sovereignty option still raises some confusion in Quebeckers' minds. Nevertheless, support for sovereignty does reflect a general willingness to give the government of Quebec sole responsibility for the bulk of domestic policies, with the exception of economic policies, about which opinions are ambivalent or divided.},

The secessionist Parti Qu{\'e}b{\'e}cois had become the leader of this debate, which also coincided with a rise of right-wing nativist, populist and sometimes authoritarian movements in other Western societies. This paper aims to evaluate the similarity or dissimilarity of Quebec's nationalism to these other nationalisms. We use the 2015 Canadian Election Study data to explore the influence of authoritarianism, nativism and populism directly on support for secession and also, indirectly, on voting intentions. We find that authoritarianism has a negative influence on support for Quebec independence and independentist parties, while the pattern is the opposite, and the effects somewhat weaker, for nativism and populism. Hence, we argue that Quebec nationalism does not seem to correlate with the right-wing populist movement extending throughout many Western societies. Thus, Quebec nationalism was shown to be a distinct form of nationalism.},

  abstract = {This paper explores ethnic and religious minority youth perspectives of security and nationalism in Scotland during the independence campaign in 2014. We discuss how young people co-construct narratives of Scottish nationalism alongside minority ethnic and faith identities in order to feel secure. By critically combining literature from feminist geopolitics, international relations (IR) and children's emotional geographies, we employ the concept of `ontological security'. The paper departs from statecentric approaches to security to explore the relational entanglements between geopolitical discourses and the ontological security of young people living through a moment of political change. We examine how everyday encounters with difference can reflect broader geopolitical narratives of security and insecurity, which subsequently trouble notions of `multicultural nationalism' in Scotland and demonstrate ways that youth `securitize the self' (Kinnvall, 2004). The paper responds to calls for empirical analyses of youth perspectives on nationalism and security (Benwell, 2016) and on the nexus between security and emotional subjectivity in critical geopolitics (Pain, 2009; Shaw, Powell, \& De La Ossa, 2014). Funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC), this paper draws on focus group and interview data from 382 ethnic and religious minority young people in Scotland collected over the 12month period of the campaign.},

This suggests that exposure to written English bolsters nationalist attitudes as real-life out-group contact increases. These results reinforce causal claims on the contextual determinants of political attitudes.},

Utilizing Stimson's method of constructing aggregate opinion measures, data from 74 separate surveys over a 9-year period are used to construct quarterly measures of public concern over global climate change. We examine five factors that should account for changes in levels of concern: 1) extreme weather events, 2) public access to accurate scientific information, 3) media coverage, 4) elite cues, and 5) movement/countermovement advocacy. A time-series analysis indicates that elite cues and structural economic factors have the largest effect on the level of public concern about climate change. While media coverage exerts an important influence, this coverage is itself largely a function of elite cues and economic factors. Weather extremes have no effect on aggregate public opinion. Promulgation of scientific information to the public on climate change has a minimal effect. The implication would seem to be that information-based science advocacy has had only a minor effect on public concern, while political mobilization by elites and advocacy groups is critical in influencing climate change concern.},

It is a multilingual and multicultural territory, where both Catalan and Spanish enjoy the status of co-official language. Adding to this, over the course of the last two decades there has been a growing movement that has called for the independence of Catalonia from Spain, one which frequently places linguistic concerns at its centre. Against this backdrop, we report on a project that qualitatively examines the language ideologies of university students in the period after the 2017 Catalan independence referendum. Specifically, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 33 undergraduate students attending three universities from the wider Barcelona area. We examined the language ideologies of this cohort through the theoretical lens of linguistic authority, in particular, the concepts of anonymity and authenticity. Two central themes emerged from the data analysis: `Catalan: ``lingered'' authenticity?' and `Spanish: glocal anonymity'. The findings reveal a complex array of language ideologies toward both Catalan and Spanish. Furthermore, in an ever-changing socio-political and sociolinguistic landscape in Catalonia, we maintain that qualitative methods can act as a powerful tool when examining cases of complex multilingualism.},

The data, gathered from six focus groups, provide an insight on the nature of linguistic authority in contemporary Catalonia. Two themes emerge in the informants' discussion of Catalan and Spanish: `twenty-first Century Catalanisme' and `Embracing Linguistic Diversity'. The comments of the respondents indicate that, against the backdrop of the independence process in the region, bilingualism and multilingualism have become highly valued in the territory. In addition, this study suggests that a fuller understanding of the situation in Catalonia may be facilitated by qualitative approaches, which explore attitudes in-depth.},

More recently, there has been an evolution in South Korean nationalism that is based on strikingly different notions particularly among young people. This paper argues that a new South Korean nationalism is emerging and that it has, what I term, globalised cultural characteristics. These characteristics challenge the role of ethnicity in young people's conception of the South Korean nation and its component members. This paper details the evolution of South Korea's nationalism and explains its implications for Korean politics and society as well as its comparative significance for other national contexts. It also highlights some elements of this evolving nationalism that demonstrate less cosmopolitan characteristics, such as patriarchy and social class, in determining who can be `imagined' as a member of this changing South Korean nation.},

  abstract = {The development of federalism in the context of the neoliberal era in the 2000s has partly created the conditions for a more stable co-operation between the federal and Quebec governments, contributing to the trend of separatism being sidelined in Quebec. In the context of neoliberalism, federal-provincial agreements have created conditions for just enough asymmetry in the relationship between the federal government and Quebec, something that Quebec has historically demanded, for separatism to remain off the agenda. What separates this relationship from past ones is a significant change in the context whereby the neoliberal orientation is becoming the common currency for co-operation. If Canadian federalism continues its present course under neoliberalism without any major mishaps, for the first time since the divisive period of the 1990s and early 2000s, federal-Quebec relations likely will be stable without national unity crises of the kind that culminated in the 1980 and 1995 Quebec referenda on sovereignty.

Ce qui s{\'e}pare cette relation de celles du pass{\'e} est un changement significatif dans le contexte dans lequel l'orientation n{\'e}o-lib{\'e}rale devient la monnaie commune pour la coop{\'e}ration.

Attitudes toward the referendum proposal and process and its possible consequences for the country had important effects on the vote. However, net of these and other factors, voters' economic evaluations were influential. The political economy of the vote was such that widespread dissatisfaction with a faltering economy eroded support for the referendum proposal by lowering support for a government that had negotiated the constitutional accord and campaigned vigorously on its behalf.}

We use Nadeau et al.'s data to demonstrate that their interaction-effects model is overly complex and suffers from serious multicollinearity difficulties. A simpler main-effects model has virtually identical explanatory power and removes anomalous findings. We also argue that their model is too simple because it omits variables such as party identification, feelings about party leaders and government performance evaluations that voters use as heuristic devices to help them make decisions when stakes are high and information about the costs and benefits of referendum outcomes is low. We analyse a dataset that includes these variables and demonstrate that they have strong effects in a model of referendum voting that controls for perceived costs and benefits of alternative referendum outcomes and several other variables. Additionally, differences in the magnitudes of the perceived costs and perceived benefits of alternative referendum outcomes are not statistically significant. This latter finding contradicts widely cited experimental results in behavioural economics and related `asymmetry' hypotheses concerning the presumed status quo bias in major referendums.},

This contribution analyzes the shifting power dynamics within mainstream Catalan nationalism over the last decade, challenging simplistic notions of ``top-down'' and ``bottom-up'' pressures for change. In fact, the movement is now inherently multidimensional---partly thanks to the pivotal role of the cultural elites and their grasp of the power of new media---and this in itself accounts in large part for its success.},

A titre d'exemple, la conscience ethnique canadienne fran{\c c}aise, la m{\'e}fiance du gouvernement f{\'e}d{\'e}ral, et le m{\'e}contentement produisent les effets ind{\'e}pendants les plus forts chez la classe moyenne tandis que l'ins{\'e}curit{\'e}{\'e}conomique et l'orientation {\'e}conomico-politique de gauche exercent en g{\'e}n{\'e}ral une influence des plus forte chez les man{\oe}uvres et les fermiers. This paper reports a secondary analysis of 1968 survey data on the extent and correlates of separatist opinion among French-speaking adults in Quebec. The analysis focuses on determinants of separatism within new middle-class occupational levels, but some comparative data are provided for the lower classes and farmers as well. A model of separatist support is constructed based on an interpretation of the previous literature and, controlling for occupational level, the effects of seven independent and intervening variables are explored in path analyses. The model of separatist support fits the new middle class best and explains 40 per cent of the variance in the dependent variable for professionals and semiprofessionals and 43 per cent for managers, officials, and proprietors. The effect of the independent variables on separatist support varied by occupational level. For example, French-Canadian ethnic consciousness, distrust of the federal government and personal dissatisfaction had their strongest independent effects within the new middle class, while economic insecurity and left politicoeconomic orientation generally had their strongest effects on separatist support among unskilled workers and farmers.},

We provide the first longitudinal analysis of the impact of Quebec independence in federal elections using the Canadian Election Study from 2000 to 2021. Our findings show that, as expected, attitudes toward Quebec secession in explaining citizens' vote choice were more important at the beginning of the twenty-first century, although only when comparing the discrepancy between the 2000 and 2004 elections. Between 2006 and 2021, the importance of Quebec independence has remained stable and key in explaining electoral outcomes.},

It is the result of ongoing interaction between individuals and their globalised socio-cultural environment that leads to changes in self-identification. Cultural openness and the ``de-territorialisation'' of identity are the key aspects of this process. e paper explores the globalisation of identities among secondary school students, using the concept of global self-identification. e analysis employs quantitative data from the Survey of Young People's Cultural Literacy. e globalisation of identity is captured by the Global Identity Scale (T{\"u}rken, Rudmin, 2013), which consists of two dimensions -- ``Non-nationalism'' and ``Cultural Openness''. e aim of the study is to examine to what extent young people in Slovakia can be characterised in terms of global self-identification and to identify what affects the propensity for global self-identification. Furthermore, it tests the relationship between global self-identification and other phenomena that are supposedly related to global identity. e results show that the global identity is present among young people in Slovakia. By applying multilevel modelling, we identified a variety of culture-related phenomena that affect cultural openness and non-nationalism, including multicultural interaction and cultural participation. In addition, the study confirms that type of school has a significant effect.},

  abstract = {In general terms, the news media operate according to North American norms of newsworthiness, fairness, and balance. With respect to routine political coverage, not surprisingly, there are some consistent differences of emphasis. [Arthur Siegel] (1996) has surveyed the available research. His overview permits some general observations. Not surprisingly, the major French media in Quebec focus on Quebec provincial politics and generally report on Ottawa and the test of Canada primarily in the context of Quebec interests, much as foreign correspondents would report on a neighbouring country. The English media treat Quebec politics more as a domestic matter, but with particular attention to the English-speaking minority in Quebec. De Bonville \& Vermette (1994) suggest that French and English journalists are sensitive to the interests of their audiences, but note that private broadcasts are more ethnocentric than the CBC. There are also regional differences within the English media. Other consistent patterns, such as greater attention to France in foreign news in the Quebec media, are easily explained in terms of audience interest and the availability of material in the appropriate language. It is notable that federal election coverage has been generally similar in recent elections, with the national political parties setting the agenda for the mainstream media, but the French reports pay more attention to constitutional and language issues while the English news gives greater coverage to economic issues. Quebec provincial election coverage shows greater French-English divergence, but these differences can be traced to factors such as the inevitable Ottawa-bashing that emerges in most provincial elections and the tendency of English-speaking journalists to focus not so much on Quebec issues as on the implications of the election for the rest of the country. Perhaps more important, in terms of public perceptions at least, have been news stories with high symbolic content, which reflected the heightened tension in this period. Both French and English media gave considerable attention prior to the 1992 referendum to municipalities outside Quebec declaring themselves to, be English-only jurisdictions, presented in English as a response to Quebec's French-only sign law and in Quebec as a rejection of the legitimacy of French in Canada. In Quebec, a video of the actions of a small number of protesters walking on the Quebec flag prior to the 1995 referendum campaign was replayed time and time again on French-language television and came to, symbolize disrespect for a revered symbol. It is reasonable to argue that this event was overplayed, just as the Quebec sign law has been overplayed in the English-language media. Stories gain attention not only because they are dramatic, but also because they symbolize emotions and identities. Such reports have tended to serve as symbols for French-English conflict in subsequent coverage, replayed not to portray events but to evoke emotions. Because Quebec nationalism has, by definition, a mythic quality, it is not easily challenged in Quebec political discourse (Nemni, 1992). Even when its premises are subject to challenge on factual grounds, the Quebec-based French media frequently avoid taking up the issue ([Simpson, Jeffrey], 1996). Certainly, there are serious misperceptions about the rest of Canada and about the meaning of a "yes" vote in the referendums on sovereignty. [Howe, Paul] (1998) observes, for example, that large numbers of "yes" voters in 1980 believed that Quebec would remain a province of Canada under sovereignty association and that such misperceptions were still common as the 1995 referendum approached. He reports that a 1994 poll found that many Quebeckers believed that in a sovereign Quebec, they would "continue to pay Canadian taxes" (27\%), "send MPs to Ottawa" (27\%), and "be part of Canada" (42\%) (The Globe and Mail [Toronto], July 15, 1994, p. A4; cited in Howe, 1998, p. 24, note 5). The fact that extensive public debate did not alter these misperceptions between 1980 and 1994 provides some support for the hypothesis that the media have not done a very good job of challenging such inaccurate beliefs. (It is not clear, of course, to what extent the media can be held responsible for the persistence of these beliefs.)},

Through this extensive coverage, the media brought these instances of accommodation to the public's attention. The research studies the press coverage that 11 daily newspapers dedicated to the state of public opinion in Quebec during the active and intense development phase of the ``crisis''. The study shows that in their analysis of polls and their general framing of the mood of public opinion towards reasonable accommodation, newspapers focused mostly on the malaise in the population toward immigration and religious diversity rather than on its openness to diversity and to the positive social outcomes of immigration. In doing so, the media further anchored the popular impression that a serious social crisis was ongoing and that a wide gap in tolerance existed between Francophone Quebeckers, Quebeckers of recent immigrant background and other Canadians.},

Papineau, Mercier, H. Bourassa (at least for much of his life), Laurier, [Abbe Groulx], Duplessis, and Lesage all had different ways of resolving the paradox, but all the solutions boil down to an unwillingness to oppose federalism as long as its binational character was respected. In some sense, the paradox may also be resolved when we recall (with Michael Ignatieff in Blood and Belonging) that francophone Quebecois regard Quebec as a nation, and Canada as a state, while anglophone Canadians identify Canada as both. Some might claim that now that economic nationalism (the Quiet Revolution's "ripest fruit," according to [Louis Balthazar], p. 110) has allowed the province to develop a strong economy, Quebec may well no longer require Canada for statehood. As [Richard Desrosiers] frames it: "if there is a constant in the history of the Quebec people, it is the rise in national self-assertion and the questioning of the link with theCanadian whole" (p. 95).},

Handler draws on historical and archival research, and on interviews with Quebec and Canadian government officials, as he addresses the central question: Given the similarities between the epistemologies of both anthropology and nationalist ideology, how can one write an ethnography of nationalism that does not simply reproduce--and thereby endorse--nationalistic beliefs? Handler analyzes various responses to the nationalist vision of a threatened existence. He examines cultural tourism, ideology of the Quebec government, legislations concerning historical preservation, language legislation and policies towards immigrants and "cultural minorities." He concludes with a thoughtful meditation on the futility of nationalisms.},

Such accusations rest on two questionable assumptions: that the media are more influential than deeply rooted cultural and historical experience, and that in the reporting of Qu{\'e}bec issues, objectivity means that journalists can consider only federalism as a viable option for Quebecers. This article argues that the development of nationalism came first, with Qu{\'e}bec journalists being influenced by nationalist ideas: not the other way around. Moreover, although the Qu{\'e}bec media's coverage is different, this does not necessarily imply bias. The article focuses on the findings of two key studies of Canadian Broadcasting Corporation/Societ{\'e} Radio-Canada coverage, which failed to find any evidence of such bias, and concludes that the persistence of the view that the Qu{\'e}bec media lack objectivity and are manipulating the public on the issue of sovereignty arises out of a tradition of elite democracy.}

Through qualitative analysis of various social media posts and a comprehensive literature review, this study investigates the mechanisms through which these digital platforms perpetuate nationalistic narratives. Additionally, the paper employs visual data analysis of social media content to demonstrate the prevalence of national symbols and narratives, particularly during significant national events. The findings indicate that social media platforms not only reflect but actively shape societal trends through algorithm-driven content curation that promotes emotionally charged nationalistic posts.

Our article, however, challenges this idea: Data from representative national surveys carried out from 1981 to 2007 show that happiness rose in 45 of the 52 countries for which substantial time-series data were available. Regression analyses suggest that that the extent to which a society allows free choice has a major impact on happiness. Since 1981, economic development, democratization, and increasing social tolerance have increased the extent to which people perceive that they have free choice, which in turn has led to higher levels of happiness around the world, as the human development model suggests.},

  abstract = {A transformation of basic political priorities may be taking place in Western Europe. I hypothesize: (1) that people have a variety of needs which are given high or low priority according to their degree of fulfillment: people act on behalf of their most important unsatisfied need, giving relatively little attention to needs already satisfied---except that (2) people tend to retain the value priorities adopted in their formative years throughout adult life. In contemporary Western Europe, needs for physical safety and economic security are relatively well satisfied for an unprecedentedly large share of the population. Younger, more affluent groups have been formed entirely under these conditions, and seem relatively likely to give top priority to fulfillment of needs which remain secondary to the older and less affluent majority of the population. Needs for belonging and intellectual and esthetic self-fulfillment (characterized as ``post-bourgeois'' values) may take top priorities among the former group. Survey data from six countries indicate that the value priorities of the more affluent postwar group do contrast with those of groups raised under conditions of lesser economic and physical security. National patterns of value priorities correspond to the given nation's economic history, moreover, suggesting that the age-group differences reflect the persistence of preadult experiences, rather than life cycle effects. The distinctive value priorities imply distinctive political behavior---being empirically linked with preferences for specific political issues and political parties in a predictable fashion. If the respective age cohorts retain their present value priorities, we would expect long-term shifts in the political goals and patterns of political partisanship prevailing in these societies.},

Canadian federalism seems to be a successful compromise between today's opposing forces: capitalism and socialism, centralism and localism, globalism and sovereignty, pluralism and ethnocentrism. The UN ranks Canada at the top of its development index. Yet the close result of the 1995 referendum in Quebec has raised once again the question of the possible break-up of Canada. The US Congress listens to earnest lectures about the coming chaos, and Canadians get a strange case of Mad-Canada Disease, as an otherwise healthy body-politic begins to faint and fall from eating the offal of its own bad news, while the rest of the world looks on and does not understand.},

To date, however, academic studies of UK youth organizations have been Anglocentric, focusing on youth organizations associated with a hegemonic British state and imperial project. This paper seeks to show how youth organizations have also been used to promote alternative forms of nationalism in the UK, which have sought to challenge a British state and imperial project. Focusing explicitly on Wales, it examines how Urdd Gobaith Cymru -- the Welsh League of Youth --has played a significant role over the past 90 years in promoting a Welsh and Welsh-speaking citizenship amongst Welsh youth. Drawing on documentary and archival research, the paper discusses how the organization has fostered particular practices and identities among its members and the way in which these have been challenged in recent years; most notably as a result of a decline in the numbers of Welsh speakers in Wales and changing configurations of the meanings of Welshness. The paper concludes by arguing for the need to take seriously the role played by youth organizations in helping to shape political geographies in a devolved Britain.},

On the whole, the perception of the Maple Spring is rather negative, with editorialists and columnists interpreting the demands of the striking students as a foolish pursuit of narrow interests and the whim of spoiled kids. Moreover, in the course of discussing this event that shook Quebec in the spring of 2012, commentators also passed judgment on the ``Quebec model'' and on the particularity of Quebec within the Canadian federation. Several reviewers also compared the Maple Spring with upheavals that have swept certain European countries, such as Greece. In all cases, Quebec's difference does not draw sympathy. The public policy permeating the province is seen, at best, as irresponsible and whimsical, and at worst as being artificially maintained at the expense of Canadian taxpayers. In that context, the striking students are portrayed as spoiled children of a parasitic province.},

  abstract = {Referendums are rare events in most parliamentary democracies, and when they do occur they present an analytical puzzle. Are they such unusual events that they fall outside of the theoretical frameworks familiar to students of elections? Or, even though they enter political life infrequently, can they be understood as something not entirely foreign to our thinking about electoral politics? Here, we argue that voting in referendums such as the constitutional referendum of October 26, 1992 is driven by many of the same factors that are present in elections---parties, leaders, issues, a campaign timetable, the interplay between long- and short-term forces and the dynamic of the campaign itself. In spite of their unique features, referendums can be understood in terms of models of voting behaviour familiar to students of elections in Canada and elsewhere. But, devoid of some of the long-term partisan and social anchors which play a role in elections, their outcome is even more dependent on the short-term elements of the campaign. As such, referendums are subject to greater volatility and uncertainty than that typically found in ordinary parliamentary elections., La tenue d'un r{\'e}f{\'e}rendum est un {\'e}v{\'e}nement rare dans la plupart des syst{\`e}mes parlementaires d{\'e}mocratiques, et lorsqu'un tel cas survient, il repr{\'e}sente un casse-t{\^e}te analytique.

The `dual' political identity emerging from Chinese youth's uses of the internet is reflective of, and reinforces, their offline self.

Hence, to better understand the evolution of nationalism in Quebec, this study draws on the last six Quebec Election Studies (2007--2022) and uses an Age-Period-Cohort model to examine the relationship between generational groups and various indicators of nationalism. The results reveal that there is indeed a generational story to tell about nationalism in Quebec. The generation of the baby boomers is particularly distinct from other generations, in terms of its attachment to Quebec, its support for Quebec's independence, and its support of the Parti Qu{\'e}b{\'e}cois; whereas the Millennials are more supportive of Qu{\'e}bec Solidaire and GenXers are more likely to support the Coalition Avenir Qu{\'e}bec.

  abstract = {This article delves into the nuanced fabric of national identity among Georgian Generation Z, unraveled through a multifaceted exploration employing secondary data analysis of quantitative information, qualitative content analysis, and in-depth interviews. Situated within the broader context of Georgian Nationalism and international trends in generational perspectives, the research unveils both shared elements and distinctive characteristics shaping the identity landscape of Georgian iGen'ers. The findings illuminate a generational shift, emphasizing the dynamic nature of how Georgian youth perceive their national identity. Generation Z, born into a world saturated with the Internet and global connectivity, exhibits similarities and differences compared to international trends. Commonalities include a heightened sense of equality, commitment to inclusivity, skepticism toward political institutions, and a preference for libertarian ideology. Despite growing up in the Internet and social media era, Generation Z exhibits cautious trust in the media, reflecting an acute awareness of misinformation and the imperative of verification. The generational cohort displays a global outlook, with increased trust in international organizations and a desire to join NATO and the European Union while maintaining a significant focus on the nation-state. Noteworthy trends within Generation Z include a decline in religiosity and fatalism, an embrace of civic activism and protest, and a nuanced understanding of the distinction between Georgianness and Georgian citizenship. Ethnic minorities are recognized as integral parts of the nation, departing from ethnic nationalism. Distinct national markers identified through civil demonstrations include a solid attachment to the Georgian people, a pronounced enemy image directed at the Soviet Union and Russia, and emotional connections with national symbols such as the map, flag, Georgian banquets, and the history of the fight for independence. In conclusion, this study enriches the discourse on national identity formation by offering a constructive narrative that navigates beyond primordial perspectives. The identified national markers, manifest in civic activism, enemy imagery, and emotional connections with symbols, collectively contribute to a materialised expression of national identity and a source of pride among Georgian Generation Z.},

  abstract = {The article identifies two schools of thought on why Quebeckers choose to support or oppose sovereignty - the rational choice approach that has focused on individuals' assessments of the collective costs and benefits of sovereignty for the Quebec economy and the French language, and the socio-psychological approach that has focused on variables such as resentment, feelings of status denial, ethnic grievances and self-confidence. It has been difficult to resolve disputes between the two approaches due to weakness in available data and a lack of a comparative approach amongst scholars. Using a data set explicitly designed to compare the two schools, this article examines whether previous researchers' conclusions hold even when concepts are operationalized in different ways and when models are specified using different variables. The author examines five general dimensions: the state of the economy, the state of the French language, the state of federalism, respect and recognition, and the perceived quality of relations between English and French speakers. The major substantive conclusion is that the previous scholarship on the motivations for vote choice have significantly overestimated the importance of assessments of the French language, significantly underestimated the importance of assessments of whether Quebeckers are respected and recognized within Canada, and have also underestimated the importance of assessments of federalism and the quality of relations between linguistic groups. These conclusions hold for even the most ambivalent voters.},

Yet this surge of interest leaves at least two important questions unanswered. Where was nationalism before its apparent resurgence? Are contemporary forms of nationalism different from their predecessors, and can these changes be linked to digital technologies? To answer these questions, we argue for the importance of understanding the less visible ways in which digital technologies reproduce our sense of belonging to a world of nations. We discuss three such mechanisms: the architecture of internet domains, the bias of algorithms and the formation of national digital ecosystems. Next, we examine three characteristics of contemporary nationalism that can be partly linked to recent shifts in the global communication ecology: diversification, fragmentation and commodification. We conclude by considering the implications of our arguments for future research in the field.},

  abstract = {The Quebec election of 2022 brought the Coalition Avenir Qu{\'e}bec (CAQ) back to power with an even bigger victory than its first victory in 2018. This confirms the major realignment of the Quebec party system. The main aim of this article is to focus on this evolution in relation to Quebec nationalism. Using the theoretical framework of dominant parties developed by Vincent Lemieux (Les partis et leurs transformations. Le dilemme de la participation. Les Presses de l'Universit{\'e} Laval, Qu{\'e}bec, 2005), it is argued that this party system reconfiguration is based on an evolution of Quebec nationalism rather than on its decline. First, this article situates the change in the party system over time and explains the breakdown of a party system that had been shaped for most of the last 50~years by the pro-independence Parti Qu{\'e}b{\'e}cois (PQ). To understand this change, survey data are also used to illustrate the declining salience of the independence issue in public opinion while explaining the nature of the new autonomist policy of the CAQ. Finally, this article analyses the consequence of the rise of Qu{\'e}bec solidaire for the pro-independence movement and the future of the PQ as a sovereigntist intraparty coalition.},

Quebec nationalism is still a driving aspect of political debates in the National Assembly. For a majority of respondents, the Quebec state continues to play an important role in matters related to identity. Hence, nationalism remains relevant and necessary. It is also closely associated with the francophone character of Quebec. Nevertheless, this nationalism has taken a new form. Mobilizing original polling data, this paper provides a better understanding of the evolution of contemporary Quebec nationalism, as supported by the Coalition avenir Qu{\'e}bec and its autonomist political ideology and dynamic. The findings allow us to observe certain divisions on the linguistic and partisan levels. These fault lines may contribute to explain the difficulties the Quebec Liberal Party is now facing in its attempt to reconnect with the francophone electorate without disappointing its anglophone electoral base.},

In a particular case (Levine case), racism even became a principle for action and mobilization which reached several (journalistic, political, popular) spheres of society. To illustrate the spread, the banalization and the legitimization of a certain racist discourse (which uses universal arguments to delegitimize the "Other"), the analysis emphasizes the link between discourse and theory in light of recent scientific works which define the structure, the discursive elements and the mechanisms for the production of racism.},

The first part of the article deals with nationalism during the `Quiet Revolution' (1960-1966). The second part discusses the thesis that Quebec nationalism was in decline during the 1980s. This `retreat' was explained by a reduced role for government and greater North American economic integration. The last part addresses the new role of the Quebec state that emerged in the 1990s, which favored the growth of the private sector and a reconfiguration of nationalism. The failure of two major constitutional negotiations (in 1990 and 1992) gave new life to the independence movement, which culminated with a second referendum on Quebec sovereignty in 1995. Overall, this article discusses the political forms of Quebec nationalism, the societal and political projects advanced by the Quebec government, and the federal government's responses to Quebec nationalism.},

The main targets of discontent have long been the `rest of Canada' and the lower socio-economic status of Francophones. After the 1995 independence referendum, the feeling of dissatisfaction with Canada, and even resentment, gradually faded. This retreating within Quebec's borders has led many French-speaking Quebecers to become concerned about the conditions that make possible the preservation of their cultural and linguistic heritage in North America. This shift has meant that the source of concern is now individuals and groups who do not share this heritage rooted in Western Judeo-Christian values or who are perceived not to adhere to the concerns related to the preservation and development of the French character and the dominant values within the `Quebec nation'. The expression of these concerns has manifested itself primarily in debates about the place religion should occupy in public and civic spaces since the mid-2000s.},

Comparison of their responses against an international dataset (N=27,567) suggests that Canadian journalists place greater value on detached monitorial roles and claim relative autonomy from commercial and other influences on their work. Further, in comparing these findings to an influential panel study from 1999 to 2003, we conclude that the Canadian journalists' ``credo," focused on neutral reporting and oriented more to perceived public interest than to business or audience interests, remains surprisingly intact despite contemporary pressures on news forms and business models. This professed neutrality is mitigated by a desire to promote diversity and tolerance.},

We identify various policy issues likely to have swayed the vote during the Quebec 2018 election and analyze which party positions citizens prefer, and how it could have benefit or played against parties. We also provide a contextual framework where we inscribe these results within the literature on political realignment and constitutional depolarization. Results indicate that Quebec's political game is opening up with a mix of short-term discrete policy promises (i.e., electoral reform) and long-term ideological issues (i.e., the environment) having an impact on vote choice.},

  abstract = {Can age, period and cohort effects help explain support for Quebec sovereignty? Previous work on this question has focused mostly on the effects of age and cohort. We contribute to this debate by adding a period perspective. As such, our study is the first to investigate the impact of age, cohort and period effects in a single study of opinion towards sovereignty in Quebec. We take advantage of an original dataset that includes survey data collected between 1985 and 2012. We use these data to examine the impact of age, birth year and survey year on support for this constitutional option among francophone Quebeckers. Our results are in line with previous work: we show that younger Quebeckers are more likely to support sovereignty, and that some cohorts -- namely, respondents born between 1945 and 1959 -- are also more likely to favour this option. Perhaps more surprisingly, we find that specific events are comparatively the most important factor to explain fluctuations in Quebeckers' attitudes towards sovereignty.},

  abstract = {When inspectors from the Office qu{\'e}b{\'e}cois de la langue franc{\c c}aise (OQLF) objected to the use of the word ``pasta'' in a Montreal restaurant in February 2013, a backlash in news and social media erupted internationally. Ensuing pressure led to the resignation of the OQLF head and a revision of OQLF language complaint procedures; the Pastagate story also contributed to mounting negativity towards the province and its language. Social media have been credited with playing a role in the proliferation of the story and its impact. Drawing on a corpus of Tweets containing PASTAGATE, this paper uses corpus-assisted discourse studies to explore language ideologies in English and French Tweets. Findings reveal divergent language ideologies and representations of the Pastagate affair. The paper concludes by suggesting that language ideological debates in a superdiverse online world may have implications for minority languages in the offline world of nation-states.},

In particular, interpersonal monetary income disparities have to be jointly analyzed with interregional income disparities. Data from Revenue Canada, for the years 1966 and 1974, show stability in the interpersonal distribution and decrease in the interregional distribution. The analysis concludes with a critical evaluation of the social role of spatially oriented governmental institutions.},

  abstract = {This article examines the degree to which divergence in voting behavior and political attitudes between inner cities and suburbs in Canadian metropolitan areas can be explained by place of residence. As of yet, there has been very little research done on this topic in Canada. Logistic regression models derived from the 1965, 1984 and 2000 Canadian national election surveys confirm that Canadian inner cities and (particularly, outer) suburbs are diverging, and place of residence has become increasingly important in explaining this divergence. Over the study period, residents of inner cities in Canada became more likely to vote for parties of the left and to hold attitudes that would be considered on the left of the political spectrum, while suburban residents were increasingly likely to vote for parties of the right and to hold attitudes on the right of the political spectrum. The research suggests that in Canada, as in the US, the place and context of suburbia is a factor in the shift to the right. This has implications for the future direction of welfare state policy.},

  abstract = {Debates  on  nationalism  and  ethnonationalism  have  intensely  developed during  the early decade of political reformation in Indonesia, that is, in the early 2000s. At that point,  the  demand  for segregation  from  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  emerged  from several  districts,  such  as  Riau  and  Papua.  In  this  era,  the  sentiment  to  decentralised from the Republic of Indonesia has been well suppressed, particularly in some areas, Aceh included. On the other side of  the coin, the process of welfare distribution is going  well.  It  is  supported  by  the  balance  of  power  between  the  central  and  local authorities,  which  has  successfully  reduced  this  sentiment.  These  observations  were conducted through a qualitative method by conducting interviews with Generation Z, which were divided into two clusters: based on gender and the respondent's status either  as  a  student  or  a  fresh  graduate.  This  paper  investigates  the  extent  of understanding  the  nationalism  and  ethnonationalism  among  Generation  Z  in Indonesia.In-depth  interviews  were  reflectively  conducted  in  which  the  research participants  were  asked  to  answer  some  questions  and  share  their  views  and understanding of this discussion.This study concludes that Generation Z Indonesian proved  to  have  a  comprehensive  understanding  of  nationalism.  They  viewed  that modules about nationalism should be officially included in elementary and high school curricula;  thus,  the  students  will  be  exposed  and  have  a  solid  understanding  of nationalism from an early age.},
